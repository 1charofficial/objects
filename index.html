    <h2>About Spain</h2>

    <p>Spain, a country located in extreme southwestern Europe. 
        It occupies about 85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula, which it shares with its smaller neighbour Portugal.
        Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, 
        all of which have made it a favoured travel destination. The country is geographically and culturally diverse. 
        Its heartland is the Meseta, a broad central plateau half a mile above sea level. </p>
