This is still a work in progress - I will keep adding to this over the next 4 weeks. 

This little programme started with a moodle slide which caught my interest, it is the objects slide in our Javascript++ module. 
It asked me to create some functions which would provide a choice of drinks, with a couple of actions which would work out if the 
user would be able to afford the drink, with change left over.

I then thought that I could maybe take it a little further and add some extra functions such as a membership validation function and a till. 
I also plan to add a loyalty bonus scheme and a function which can change the text from english to spanish. Since the theme is a spanish theme, I thought that might be quite cool.

I then wanted to add some visually pleasing elements to style the page and add a little bit more to the theme.
This project is creative and also allows me to practice building functions, using objects, using pronpts, for of loops and the DOM. Plus I will practice my CSS skills too. 

What I will need:

1. CSS styling, imagary and possibly some animation.
2. DOM - element manipulation, the use of audio - onclick, and the ability to change image onclick or another event.
3. JS functions that allow for user input to be stored, pulled from and pushed to/updated.
